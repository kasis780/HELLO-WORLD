# HELLO-WORLD
YASSSSSSSSSSSSS I'M INNNNNNN

My name is Suranart Kasitipradit, my nickname is Ta. I'm a thai communication designer who is passionate about the idea that we are all connected, from past, present and future and that our every act of crime and kindness will birth our future. My interests include pretending to be a hippie, sexualizing ice-cream and filling my head with both necessary and unnecessary information. 

Logging off for now, bye peeps!
